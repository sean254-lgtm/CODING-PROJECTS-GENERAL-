      <p class="text">As you all know a few days ago the multiverse was facing a crisis that doomed us all. Luckily our brave super heros flash, supergirl, green arrow, the legends and others stood up to the ferocious anti monitor in an attempt to stop his foly but sadly he suceeded. The green arrow AKA Oliver Queen sacrificed himself for the creation of this new world. We will always keep his good memories intact and may he rest in peace.</p>
